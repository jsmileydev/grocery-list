## Grocery shopping list made in jQuery

[Live Demo here]: https://recipe-shopper.netlify.com/ 

Items crossed off are moved to the bottom of the list, or back to the top when uncrossed for easy readability. Click and drag to organize.

Featured with additional recipe lists that can be individually added to, and as groups added to the master shopping list. Click on recipe name to toggle display of recipe items. 

Future plans : 
Editable list items
Too many icons, too busy--create onclick modal for options
Separate current and master list, items only deletable from master list
