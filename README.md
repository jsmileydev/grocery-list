## Grocery shopping list made in jQuery

[Live Demo here](https://recipe-shopper.netlify.com/) 

Items crossed off are moved to the bottom of the list, or back to the top when uncrossed for easy readability. Click and drag to organize. Edit item name from within modal dialog form.

Featured with additional recipe lists that can be individually or as groups added to the master shopping list. Click on recipe name to toggle accordion display of recipe items. 

Future plans : 
    Too many icons--create single modal for multiple options
    Create vanilla JS version
